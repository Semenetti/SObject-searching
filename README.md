# SObject-searching

As a user I want to be able to search for a specific SObject and select a specific record.
UI part should be as close as possible to standard one excluding:
1. creation should be disabled
2. dropdown should contain only options
3. options should have only title
As a developer I want to be able to reuse that component in Aura or LWC components and configure:
1. which SObject should be searched for
2. additional filtration
